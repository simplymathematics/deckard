# Deckard: A Tool for Evaluating AI

## 1 - Dependencies

To install this, ensure that you have your favorite library installed. To install deckard along with `tensorflow`, for example, use
```
python -m pip install .[tensorflow]
```
Add the `-e` flag if you want to edit files:
```
python -m pip install -e .
```
Or try the rpi script:
```
bash rpi.sh
```
Now, check that deckard works
```$ python```
```>>> import deckard```
Then CTRL+D or `quit()` to quit.
##  2 - Navigate to your favorite subfolder in `examples`. One is provided for each framework.
Running `dvc repro` in that folder will reproduce the experiment outlined in the `dvc.yaml`. Running 
```python -m deckard```
 will parse the configuration folder, create a `params.yaml`, and then run `dvc repro`.
### _like tears in the rain_, this tool is meant for bladerunners. NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY REPLICANTS
